                This application is helping you to get an overview on the status of the
                SaaS services you rely on. It shows you which services are having a maintainance
                or an incident during the last 15min. Status are updated every 15min by
                backend running on <a href="https://lzone.de">lzone.de</a>. The backend is 
                a simple old-school feed aggregation script that you can find under <a href="https://github.com/lwindolf/multi-status">https://github.com/lwindolf/multi-status</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
                This application can be used...
                <ul>
                        <li>on a smartphone to quickly check all service you are interested in.</li>
                        <li>on a desktop (e.g. installed as a local app) serving as a monitoring window for SaaS status.</li>
                </ul>
                In any case you might want to configure a filter so only apps you are interested in are shown.
                To do so click "Filter" in the main screen.
